# Fishing-Game
Fishing game will pull from a JSON file featuring 25+ fishes, from different categories of rarity, common to epic and a few secret easter egg fishes.
Number generates the fish, the type of the fish (such as color or species) the length of the fish, and weight of the fish based off the fish's parameters.
Message will display with the fish that is caught, the length and weight, and a short blurb about the fish. 

#API Branch
The fishing game when deployed as an API will serve a request to server.js with a random fish and the attached blurb.
